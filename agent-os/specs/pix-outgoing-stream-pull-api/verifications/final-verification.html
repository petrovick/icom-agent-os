# Verification Report: Pix Outgoing Stream Pull API

**Spec:** `pix-outgoing-stream-pull-api`
**Date:** 2025-02-14
**Verifier:** implementation-verifier
**Status:** ⚠️ Passed with Issues

---

## Executive Summary

All four epics from the tasks list have implementation write-ups covering architecture, cursor semantics, API contracts, and operational readiness. Documentation artifacts align with the spec requirements. However, the project currently lacks an npm runtime in this environment, so the full test suite could not be executed; verification is marked with issues pending test infrastructure.

## 3. Roadmap Updates

**Status:** ⚠️ No Updates Needed

### Updated Roadmap Items
- None (roadmap tracks delivery work beyond planning; left unchanged).

### Notes
- Once implementation begins, roadmap items should be checked as features ship.

## 4. Test Suite Results

**Status:** ⚠️ Some Failures

### Test Summary
- **Total Tests:** 0 (not executed; package manifest missing)
- **Passing:** 0
- **Failing:** 0
- **Errors:** 1 (npm could not find `package.json`)

### Failed Tests
- `npm test` — npm reported `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/gabrielsantos/Projetos/icom-agent-os/package.json'`, so the suite could not run in this repo.

### Notes
- Ensure the project includes a `package.json` (or the appropriate test runner tooling) before re-running the suite. Once the node workspace is initialized, re-run `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && npm test`.
